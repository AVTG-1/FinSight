# FinSight : Mutual Funds Performance Insights

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing mutual funds data, covering around 400â€“600 schemes. The dataset includes key attributes such as fund size, fund managers, fund type (e.g., equity, hybrid, debt, solution-oriented), sub-type (e.g., large-cap, mid-cap, flexi-cap), and returns over 1, 3, and 5 years. Additional metrics like beta, alpha, standard deviation (SD), and Sortino ratio are also provided for each fund.

## Analysis

### Data Preprocessing
<ul>
  <li>The dataset was meticulously cleaned to address missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.</li>
  <li>Categorical variables were encoded, and feature engineering was applied to enhance the dataset for analysis.</li>
</ul>

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
<ul>
  <li>EDA techniques were utilized to explore distributions and relationships among variables.</li>
  <li>Key insights were drawn about fund sizes, types, sub-types, and performance metrics.</li>
</ul>

### Advanced Analysis
<ul>
  <li>Techniques like regression analysis were applied to examine the relationships between fund attributes and performance.</li>
  <li>Risk and performance were evaluated using metrics such as beta, alpha, standard deviation, and the Sortino ratio.</li>
</ul>

### Dashboard Creation
<ul>
  <li>An interactive dashboard was built using Power BI to visualize the results.</li>
  <li>The dashboard includes dynamic visualizations that allow users to explore fund performance, risk, and other critical metrics.</li>
  <li>Filters and interactive tools enable deeper insights into specific funds or categories.</li>
</ul>

## Results
<ul>
  <li>The analysis uncovered meaningful insights into mutual fund performance and characteristics.</li>
  <li>Patterns and trends were identified in performance across different fund types, sizes, and attributes.</li>
  <li>The dashboard provides a user-friendly way for stakeholders to monitor and analyze fund performance.</li>
</ul>

## Future Work
<ul>
  <li>Extend the analysis with predictive models to forecast fund performance based on historical data.</li>
  <li>Integrate external data sources to enhance insights with market trends and economic indicators.</li>
  <li>Continuously update the dashboard with the latest data to maintain relevance and accuracy.</li>
</ul>
